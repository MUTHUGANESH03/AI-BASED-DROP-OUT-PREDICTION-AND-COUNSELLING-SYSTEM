## 🚀 Features

### 🔍 **Dropout Risk Prediction**

* Predicts the likelihood of student dropout using ML algorithms.
* Uses academic, demographic, and behavioural input parameters.
* Displays results visually (risk percentages / categories).

### 🧭 **AI Counselling Recommendations**

* Provides automated counselling suggestions based on risk level.
* Suggests academic, psychological, and behavioural interventions.
* Helps staff take informed decisions.

### 🖥️ **Frontend (React / Web App)**

* User-friendly dashboard for data input.
* Clean UI for viewing prediction results.
* Interactive forms and data visualization.

### 🛠️ **Backend (Node / Python / ML Model)**
